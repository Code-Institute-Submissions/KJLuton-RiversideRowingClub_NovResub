# Features

The website consists of 3 pages. All are accessible from the navigation menu. 

The website has the below features: 

## Existing Features

### Elements on every page

#### Navigation bar 

* The navbar is fully responsive and adapts to tablet and mobile devices by changing to a burger menu. 
* The navbar is a fixed feature which stays at the top of the page as the user scrolls down. This ensures they can navigate to another page easily if they wish to do so. 
* It features the Riverside Rowing Club Logo as an image, on the far left of the Navbar. The logo can be used as a navigation tool on all pages, to navigate back to the homepage. 
* To the right of the logo, there are 3 links which collapse into a burger menu on smaller screen sizes. The menu contains the following page names and links: 
    * Home
    * Join Us
    * Contact

#### Footer 
* Like the navigation bar, the footer is consitent across all pages. It has social links on the right hand side which change colour as you hover over them. Each link will open in a separate browser. On large and medium sized screens, the full Riverside Rowing Club logo is in the center. This disappears on smaller screens. The user can still clearly see the logo via the logo in the fixed navbar. 

#### Banner Images
* There are banner images across the site which provide context to the website as well as giving the user some insight to the activties the club participates in. They create emotive connections with the club. This will help with gaining new memberships. 

#### End of Section logos
* There are small oar icons (the oar-section of the RRC logo) which are displayed at the end of each text section. These are placed throughout the site to keep the layout consistent and tie the sections back to the RRC brand. 

#### Alert bar 
* The alert bar is visible on the "Homepage" and "Join Us" pages of the website. It is dismissable by a small cross on the far right of the bar. The alert bar notfies the user of the "Learn to Row" courses and has a call to action to encourage users to contact us and find out more. There is a link directing the user to the "Contact Us" page of the website, where the user can use the contact form to ask questions and book a slot on the course. 

* The dismisable feature is possible due to the JavaScript plugin. 

### Homepage

#### Welcome banner and hero image
* The welcome banner is at the top of the page with the hero image below. The structure is created through a link to the URL in the HTML. The header text adjusts to the screensize due to a media query. The hero image adjusts to screen size with the aid of the Bootstrap integration. 

#### About Us 
* The 'About Us' section informs new users about the club. It informs the user of the club location, the types of squads and gives the user an idea what kind of club the Riverside Rowing Club is. It informs the user of the 'Learn to Row' courses and provides a link to push any prospective members to the 'join us' page to find out more about joining the club. 

#### Useful links
* The 'Useful Link's section provides members and non-members with important links they will need within the rowing community, throughout the rowing season. The links are button links and the text changes colour and the mouse turns to a pointer to inform the user that they have hovered over a button. The links are external links and open on a new page. 

* When viewed on a small screened device, the buttons stack on top of each other instead of being two side by side. This allows them to stay large and improves usability whilst on a smaller screen. 

#### Racing and training kit 
* The 'Racing and Training Kit' section displays the kit the members can by. The information is displayed on Bootstrap 'cards' which have been adpated via customised CSS to match the style of the website. 

* This section includes information on who designed the kit, how to order the kit and a link to the contact form. 

## Join Us page 

#### Page header and image
* Similarly to the Homepage, the join us page has a yellow banner at the top with the page title. There is also a banner image below the yellow bar. This layout style is mirrored from the homepage to allow continuity across the site. 

#### Squads section
* The Squads section uses Bootstrap columns to display text next to imagery in a greyed out section. This 

#### Membership Fees 
* The Membership Fees section displays a table which clearly outlines the fees for the various squad and membership types. There is also a call to action to use the contact form to inquire about membership. 

#### Club Facilities
* The Club's facilities are displayed using Font Awesome icons. There is a header underneath the icon to explain the facility. 

#### Contact Us page
* The 'Contact Us' page hosts a contact form whereby users (both new and existing) can contact the Club Committee by filling out the form, selecting their query type from a drop down list provided and writing a text message. The form clears once the user submits the message. The fields are compulsory and prompt the user, should they miss a field. 

* To develop this section further, I would use an alert notification to inform the user that their message had been sent. 

## Future implementations

Further developments I would make to the sites features would be: 
* Add a confirmation notification for the contact form to notify the user of a successful message send. 
* Add a Membership creation area where prospective members can apply for membership online.
* Create a sign-in area for Members which can host exclusive members information about their fees, club training plans and member exclusive events. 
* Add a data capture form for a newsletter. 
* Add a google location with map integration to allow users to find the club easily.
