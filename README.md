The project was deployed to GitHub Pages. Gitpod was used as the development workspace. I committed and logged all changes to the project, using the git command control system. At the end of each session, I used the git push command in the GitPod terminal to push all changes to the GitHub repository.

* From 'source', click where it says 'none' and update to 'branch: Master'.
